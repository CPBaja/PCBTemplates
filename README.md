# Altium PCB Project Templates

- `LayerStackups\`: Contains a set of different layer stackups for designing boards in **Altium Designer** to be manufactured by **JLCPCB**.  Each stackup contains differeential impedance profiles for 90Ω (USB) and 120Ω (CAN).  All values for material thickness and dielectric coefficient were found on https://jlcpcb.com/impedance
  ├── `4LayereStackup` : Basic 4 layer stackup based on the JLCPCB 4 layer - no requirement stackup.
  ├── `6LayereStackup` : Basic 4 layer stackup based on the JLCPCB 6 layer - no requirement stackup.
  ├── `8LayereStackup` : Basic 4 layer stackup based on the JLCPCB 8 layer - no requirement stackup.
